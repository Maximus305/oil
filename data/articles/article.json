        "content": "(Reuters) — The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency on Tuesday formally gave West Virginia authority to oversee carbon capture projects in the state, the fourth state granted such ability. The agency signed a final rule granting primary enforcement authority, known as primacy, to West Virginia to permit so-called Class VI wells in order to speed up the approvals and advance the development of massive carbon sequestration projects. \"As one of my first acts as EPA Administrator, I am proud to sign this rule to allow West Virginia the independence it needs to permit and regulate itself, while also working to safeguard our environment and drinking water,\" said EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin. Carbon capture and storage is an emerging technology that aims to pull carbon dioxide emissions from industrial sources before they reach the atmosphere for storage underground. Over a dozen states have carbon sequestration projects planned or in development and are awaiting approvals by the EPA, which has been a slow process. North Dakota, Wyoming and Louisiana are the three other states that have been granted authority to oversee their own CO2 injection permitting and oversight. Last week, Texas oil, gas and industrial groups urged Zeldin to speed up the state's request for primacy. Texas has 43 projects under review - one-third of all U.S. applications. The Biden administration's 2022 Inflation Reduction Act contains billions of dollars of subsidies, including a lucrative $85 per metric ton tax credit for storing CO2 in geological formations. While President Donald Trump has vowed to gut the IRA, Biden's landmark climate-change legislation, energy experts say such subsidies will likely survive due to strong support from Republican states and lawmakers."

        "content": "A U.S. regulator on Wednesday proposed new rules to strengthen safety requirements for carbon dioxide and hazardous liquid pipelines at a time when carbon capture technologies see increased adoption to fight global warming. The new regulations will strengthen existing standards and, for the first time, establish new norms for transporting carbon dioxide in a gaseous state via pipeline, the U.S. Department of Transportation's Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration (PHMSA) said. The U.S. has forecast an increase in carbon dioxide pipelines across the country as the fight against global warming leads to greater adoption of carbon capture and sequestration technologies. One of the rules requires more detailed vapor dispersion analyses to better protect the public and the environment in case of a pipeline failure. 'I have learned firsthand from affected communities in Mississippi and across America why we need stronger CO2 (carbon dioxide) pipeline safety standards,' PHMSA Deputy Administrator Tristan Brown said. In 2020, Denbury's 24-inch Delta Pipeline ruptured in Satartia, Mississippi, releasing thousands of barrels of CO2, which resulted in local evacuations and caused 45 people to be hospitalized. Liquid CO2 vaporizes when released to the atmosphere, and the vapor is 1.53 times heavier than air. It displaces oxygen, potentially asphyxiating humans and animals, according to PHMSA. In 2023, Denbury and PHMSA settled on a penalty of about $2.8 million, nearly $1 million less than the initial proposal in 2022."

The permits, granted to Carbon TerraVault JV Storage Company Sub 1 LLC (CTV), a subsidiary of California Resources Corporation (CRC), mark a significant step in efforts to reduce carbon dioxide emissions and combat climate change. The permits authorize the construction of four deep injection wells in the Elk Hills Oil Field, approximately 20 miles west of Bakersfield. These wells, set to be drilled to depths exceeding a mile below the surface, will inject and permanently store carbon dioxide in the Monterey Formation. Over the 26-year project lifespan, CTV plans to inject 1.5 million metric tons of carbon dioxide annually, totaling nearly 38 million metric tons. \"This permit is authorized because the Safe Drinking Water Act allows for carbon injection projects that protect drinking water sources,\" said Martha Guzman, EPA Pacific Southwest Regional Administrator. \"EPA worked to ensure the permit includes continuous monitoring for carbon dioxide leaks, with data made publicly available. Additionally, CTV must plug 200 abandoned wells in the project area before injection begins.\" EPA conducted an extensive technical review of the permit application, evaluating geologic data, seismic activity, and the integrity of surrounding formations. The agency concluded that the Monterey Formation is well-suited for carbon storage, with a confining zone to prevent migration of carbon dioxide. The permits require rigorous monitoring of well integrity, groundwater quality, and carbon dioxide movement. Surface-level air and leak detection monitoring will ensure injected carbon dioxide remains underground, with data accessible through a public website. Emergency response plans are also mandated to address potential issues. Before injection operations can start, CTV must plug 200 abandoned wells in the area to ensure containment. EPA will verify these activities and approve final records to confirm compliance. The project also includes financial safeguards, with $30 million secured for well plugging, post-injection site care, and emergency measures. While the permits allow carbon dioxide injection under the federal Safe Drinking Water Act, CTV must adhere to additional state and local regulations. The permits will remain in effect throughout the project's operation and post-injection site care until closure is completed."
