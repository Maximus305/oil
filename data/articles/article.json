        "content": "(Reuters) — The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency on Tuesday formally gave West Virginia authority to oversee carbon capture projects in the state, the fourth state granted such ability. The agency signed a final rule granting primary enforcement authority, known as primacy, to West Virginia to permit so-called Class VI wells in order to speed up the approvals and advance the development of massive carbon sequestration projects. \"As one of my first acts as EPA Administrator, I am proud to sign this rule to allow West Virginia the independence it needs to permit and regulate itself, while also working to safeguard our environment and drinking water,\" said EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin. Carbon capture and storage is an emerging technology that aims to pull carbon dioxide emissions from industrial sources before they reach the atmosphere for storage underground. Over a dozen states have carbon sequestration projects planned or in development and are awaiting approvals by the EPA, which has been a slow process. North Dakota, Wyoming and Louisiana are the three other states that have been granted authority to oversee their own CO2 injection permitting and oversight. Last week, Texas oil, gas and industrial groups urged Zeldin to speed up the state's request for primacy. Texas has 43 projects under review - one-third of all U.S. applications. The Biden administration's 2022 Inflation Reduction Act contains billions of dollars of subsidies, including a lucrative $85 per metric ton tax credit for storing CO2 in geological formations. While President Donald Trump has vowed to gut the IRA, Biden's landmark climate-change legislation, energy experts say such subsidies will likely survive due to strong support from Republican states and lawmakers."

The new regulations will strengthen existing standards and, for the first time, establish new norms for transporting carbon dioxide in a gaseous state via pipeline, the U.S. Department of Transportation's Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration (PHMSA) said. The U.S. has forecast an increase in carbon dioxide pipelines across the country as the fight against global warming leads to greater adoption of carbon capture and sequestration technologies. One of the rules requires more detailed vapor dispersion analyses to better protect the public and the environment in case of a pipeline failure. 'I have learned firsthand from affected communities in Mississippi and across America why we need stronger CO2 (carbon dioxide) pipeline safety standards,' PHMSA Deputy Administrator Tristan Brown said. In 2020, Denbury's 24-inch Delta Pipeline ruptured in Satartia, Mississippi, releasing thousands of barrels of CO2, which resulted in local evacuations and caused 45 people to be hospitalized. Liquid CO2 vaporizes when released to the atmosphere, and the vapor is 1.53 times heavier than air. It displaces oxygen, potentially asphyxiating humans and animals, according to PHMSA. In 2023, Denbury and PHMSA settled on a penalty of about $2.8 million, nearly $1 million less than the initial proposal in 2022."

The permits, granted to Carbon TerraVault JV Storage Company Sub 1 LLC (CTV), a subsidiary of California Resources Corporation (CRC), mark a significant step in efforts to reduce carbon dioxide emissions and combat climate change. The permits authorize the construction of four deep injection wells in the Elk Hills Oil Field, approximately 20 miles west of Bakersfield. These wells, set to be drilled to depths exceeding a mile below the surface, will inject and permanently store carbon dioxide in the Monterey Formation. Over the 26-year project lifespan, CTV plans to inject 1.5 million metric tons of carbon dioxide annually, totaling nearly 38 million metric tons. \"This permit is authorized because the Safe Drinking Water Act allows for carbon injection projects that protect drinking water sources,\" said Martha Guzman, EPA Pacific Southwest Regional Administrator. \"EPA worked to ensure the permit includes continuous monitoring for carbon dioxide leaks, with data made publicly available. Additionally, CTV must plug 200 abandoned wells in the project area before injection begins.\" EPA conducted an extensive technical review of the permit application, evaluating geologic data, seismic activity, and the integrity of surrounding formations. The agency concluded that the Monterey Formation is well-suited for carbon storage, with a confining zone to prevent migration of carbon dioxide. The permits require rigorous monitoring of well integrity, groundwater quality, and carbon dioxide movement. Surface-level air and leak detection monitoring will ensure injected carbon dioxide remains underground, with data accessible through a public website. Emergency response plans are also mandated to address potential issues. Before injection operations can start, CTV must plug 200 abandoned wells in the area to ensure containment. EPA will verify these activities and approve final records to confirm compliance. The project also includes financial safeguards, with $30 million secured for well plugging, post-injection site care, and emergency measures. While the permits allow carbon dioxide injection under the federal Safe Drinking Water Act, CTV must adhere to additional state and local regulations. The permits will remain in effect throughout the project's operation and post-injection site care until closure is completed."

        "content": "Southern Star is a key player in the natural gas sector. Headquartered in Owensboro, Ky., the company conducts operations across seven states in the United States' Midwest region – Kansas, Oklahoma, Missouri, Wyoming, Colorado, Texas and Nebraska. For more than a century, Southern Star has built its reputation as a safe and reliable vendor for the transportation and storage of natural gas.\n Overseeing 5,800 miles of pipeline, 43 compressor stations and eight gas porosity storage fields, the company has many assets and work processes to manage and maintain. To service its customers and communities, Southern Star relies on a robust enterprise asset management solution to support operations over this vast and varied territory.\n 'One Community Working Together.' To support its company vision, natural gas transporter Southern Star Central Gas Pipeline harnesses an enterprise asset management (EAM) solution with collaboration at its core. A tool that enables multiple teams, across various locations, to access the shared data and information they need to drive safe and reliable operations across the board. Since 2017, this solution has been HxGN EAM.\n\nKey business needs. In 2017, Southern Star embarked on a new journey. The company knew technology would be key in improving its services. \"If we really wanted to push the reliability and safety envelope, we needed more robust systems,\" says Stuart Johnson, Southern Star's Manager of Planning and Scheduling. This need was the catalyst that encouraged Southern Star to turn toward enterprise asset management. The multifunctional capabilities of an EAM solution, such as HxGN EAM, offered support for both asset and work management activities.\n Johnson explains that before HxGN EAM, the organization was using legacy systems that were developed internally. \"(These systems) helped us maintain compliance and keep the company on track. But it was time for us to look more toward solutions that we could deploy that would help us become a more reliable company.\"\n To achieve this, Southern Star required an asset and work management solution that met its diverse operational needs, helped modernize its assets and had the ability to expand as the business grew. Another key priority was finding a \"one-package solution;\" a solution with plenty of mobility capabilities to avoid investing in additional third-party software.\n\nHxGN EAM: A one-stop shop asset management solution. Adopting HxGN EAM has benefited Southern Star in several ways. Many of these benefits stem from EAM's \"all encompassing\" nature. The solution's multifunctionality means that it can use the same software and service across various teams and territories, for several purposes.\n \"Today, Southern Star uses HxGN EAM for all our operations and maintenance work that we perform in the field. So, we probably have about 100,000 work orders that we issue and complete every year. We also track a lot of our environmental services that we perform there ... so we're using it in multiple different ways these days,\" says Johnson.\n The adoption of only one solution saves the company time, increases efficiency and eliminates the need to invest in multiple products to get the job done. Southern Star's employees can perform their roles with more ease using just one platform. Plus, during rollout, users only needed to get used to a single new system, making uptake a lot easier.\n Mobility. Another key capability of HxGN EAM that is essential to Southern Star's operations is the solution's mobility capabilities. Johnson says this feature led HxGN EAM to become a frontrunner during the search for a new tool. Mobility is crucial to orchestrating work orders and scheduling for teams in eight states. Coordinating operations across such a large territory calls for an agile asset management solution. The embedded mobility capabilities of HxGN EAM also mean it does not have to rely on third-party software to make the most out of the tool. This drives both efficiency and cost-effectiveness.\n Driving modernization. Optimized asset management plays into a wider modernization journey. A journey that Johnson says will happen faster with HxGN EAM on board. \"Since Southern Star began using HxGN EAM, we've seen a lot of improvements. Most notably, we saw a 25% increase in efficiency. And so that ... allowed us to be able to move quicker into a modernization program that we've been working on to really increase the reliability of our assets.\"\n Equipped with a single solution that draws together siloed data, Southern Star unlocks additional time to focus on other areas of business that secure safety and reliability. This time is also well spent on current operations and making sure that they are being carried out optimally.\n Challenges to overcome. When considering the adoption of an EAM solution, prior to 2017, the company had to take several challenges into account. First and foremost, it needed to find a solution that enabled it to maintain its high performance across a vast and varied territory. A tool that would provide a clear oversight of the company's operations, assets and field data. At this time, Southern Star grappled with siloed data, available only at certain locations or headquarters. Now, HxGN EAM consolidates this data in a single platform, so that it may be easily accessed by any team, any time, from anywhere.\n Another obstacle in the organization's path was the need to transform operations and incorporate new technologies without the capacity to grow its IT team. HxGN EAM offered a solution to this. The solution's mobility capabilities enable multiple teams to use the same tool. This mitigates the need to add additional software, requiring a larger team to integrate and operate these systems and further investment.\n Additionally, Southern Star required a mobile solution that could provide both metropolitan and rural areas with a quality service. In remote locations, this was a challenge due to a frequent lack of internet coverage. However, Hexagon's disconnected mobile capabilities provided a solution. The HxGN EAM Field Work mobile app enabled Southern Star's teams to automate and capture work in real-time, whether connected or disconnected to a Wide Area Network (WAN) connection.\n Business achievements powered by HxGN EAM. Alongside the 25% increase in efficiency using HxGN EAM, Southern Star has also optimized its time and resources through asset management. \"About three years in was when we met our return on investment,\" says Johnson. \"That was a big milestone and definitely makes the whole endeavor worthwhile.\"\n Looking ahead, Southern Star plans to expand its use of HxGN EAM even further, beyond only work and asset management, to other activities related to daily operations. Environmental, social and governance matters, for example, can be tracked using HxGN EAM's case management feature.\n The role of data will also likely expand as the company sets sights on using the solution to start mining data, automating processes where needed, to become more efficient. Building a bank of data over time will only support this to greater extent. Johnson comments, \"The future is bright at Southern Star. As we dig into our asset data ... we've compiled enough data that there's going to be opportunities for us to review processes, look for new efficiencies, be able to find ways to increase our reliability [and] decrease the cost of our parts and materials for expense.\"\n Efficiency, reliability and safety, all secured with the support of HxGN EAM.\n Creating a plan of action to optimize your organization's approach to asset management?
